                            <p class="text-white-75 gap-0">I am currently in my fourth and final year of the Computer Science program at Conestoga College's Waterloo campus 
                                                        and I love it! The first year 
                                                        really gave me a really good taste into what Conestoga is like, but most importantly what 
                                                        Computer Science is all about. This program has been teaching me a lot about the general 
                                                        Computer Science world, and giving little snippits of what it's like to work in the different 
                                                        areas. The courses I took recently included:</p>

                            <p class="text-warning mb-4">Software Safety & Reliability | AI & Machine Learning
                                                        | Data Visualization | Capstone Project | Applied Data Analytics
                                                        | Advanced Topics in AI and Machine Learning | Data Mining | French Language and Culture </p>

                            <p class="text-white-75 gap-0">I've grown so much in my programming skills and team development knowledge and
                                                        it's great to see that I am taking a step closer to the Computer Science world. 
                                                        I hope to be on a developement team or designing team in the future!</p>

                            <p class="text-white-75 gap-0">Going back to my years in Highschool, I was still wondering which career I wanted to pick, and while 
                                                        I always had Computer Science in mind, I was also considering alternate careers such as becoming a professional 
                                                        athlete, a carpenter/woodworker, or a computer engineer. Preston High School was able to offer 
                                                        many university and college level courses that allowed me to pick and choose the courses that 
                                                        were best for my career of choice. Some of those college/university courses included:</p>

                            <p class="text-warning mb-4">Calculus | Advanced Functions | Chemistry | Physics | Computer Science | Computer engineering</p>

                            <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">This is a big reason why my passion for Computer Science continued to grow. I was able to learn 
                                                        about coding, how to apply those concepts, and put it into practice. Preston High School was a 
                                                        great place for my passion in Computer Science!</p>

                                    for development and for management. I also was responsible for creating custom scripts for clients who needed their finance tasks automated for bus contractor pay which increased their efficiency significantly.

                                <p class="text-white-75">In this role, I volunteered to collaborate with other members of the tech team to ensure smooth and high-quality operations during live events.
                                    I have also provided guidance to junior members regarding best practices and principles in video production techniques.
                                    This role required me to plan and execute live video production events, setting up equipment, audio and video capture, and streaming,
                                    which included operating cameras, computers, video production, broadcasting software and other related equipment.</p>
